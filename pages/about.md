# About

<!-- I built this website because i often had many ideas in my mind, about a lot of things, for example how we can develop this country. How we can make this country a better place. How people can be educated, how scientific temper can be promoted in the country, and just how can i make people more happy. Which seems to be more important than ever. There are often crazy ideas in my mind and i am always finding individuals who can turn my dream into reality. I strongly believe that highly motivated men can radically change the world. Will always look for this hit-team. If you find resonence in my ideas, feel your moral and religious duty to reach me and making shit happen. -->

The website aims to promote scientific templer in the country by faciliating mass literacy. Still in initial stages the next few years would be commited to publishing high quality scientific works in Romanised hindi and english.
