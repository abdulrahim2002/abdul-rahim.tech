# About

<!-- I built this website because i often had many ideas in my mind, about a lot of things, for example how we can develop this country. How we can make this country a better place. How people can be educated, how scientific temper can be promoted in the country, and just how can i make people more happy. Which seems to be more important than ever. There are often crazy ideas in my mind and i am always finding individuals who can turn my dream into reality. I strongly believe that highly motivated men can radically change the world. Will always look for this hit-team. If you find resonence in my ideas, feel your moral and religious duty to reach me and making shit happen. -->

The website aims to provide information on technical topics. I hope that you will find it helpfull. You can reach me out at any of the provided social media links. Thanks for visiting.
