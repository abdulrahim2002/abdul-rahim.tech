<!-- ### Are you busy or are you productive? -->
### Introduction
We often find ourselves overwhelmed with tasks, meetings, and obligations, constantly rushing from one thing to another. While, it can be overwhelming to feel like you have too much work all the time, however being busy doesn’t necessarily equate to being productive.


While being busy may make you feel occupied, productivity is about accomplishing meaningful tasks that align with your goals and priorities.


After years of struggling with these problems. These are the mnemonics that I have developed over the course of years that have helped me ascertain the essence of productivity and reclaim control of my time and energy:

#### 1. One thing at a time:
In the urge to reap maximum benefits and win the race of life and success, you try dealing with multiple tasks and are always on your toes. While the art of multitasking has long being hailed as a hallmark of smart and successful people, research suggests that it may actually hinder productivity. A study conducted by Stanford University found that people who frequently multitask are less able to filter out irrelevant information, have poorer memory, and experience difficulty focusing on a single task. Instead, practicing single-tasking can lead to improved concentration and higher-quality work.

By focusing on one task at a time, you allow yourself to fully engage with the task at hand, leading to increased efficiency and reduced errors. Start by identifying your most productive hours and assign them to tasks that require high levels of focus and creativity. This approach allows you to give your undivided attention to each task and complete them more effectively.

#### 2. Set SMART goals:
Clear goals provide a roadmap for productivity. Utilize the SMART framework when setting goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Clearly define what you want to accomplish, break it down into actionable steps, and set deadlines. By meticulously crafting these beacons of purpose, we gain a lucid roadmap to navigate our productivity voyage (Locke & Latham, 1990). Breaking down these objectives into manageable sub-tasks and adhering to a predetermined timeline further amplifies our focus and bolsters our sense of accomplishment (Kumar & Agrawal, 2020).


This approach not only enhances your focus but also gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each task. SMART goals provide a sense of purpose, direction, and motivation, propelling you towards productivity and success. Regularly review and adjust your goals to stay on track and remain motivated.


#### 3. Learn to say ‘No’:
We often overcommit ourselves, trying to please everyone or fearing missed opportunities.

> If you don’t value your time others won’t either

Saying “yes” to every request or opportunity that comes your way can quickly lead to an overloaded schedule, and eventually burnout. Learn to evaluate requests and obligations carefully.

Say no to tasks or commitments that do not align with your goals or values. Being productive requires understanding your limitations and recognizing when to delegate tasks. It’s okay to decline or delegate tasks that don’t contribute to your productivity or well-being. By setting boundaries and saying no when necessary, you protect your time and energy for meaningful endeavors.

Moreover, whether it be spending time on social media, reading depressing news, watching useless YouTube videos, or playing a mind-numbing game on your phone. We all sometimes, spend time in ways that do not work for us. They are activities that pull us in and grab hold of us. Activities that drain us of our energy. Always remember that these platforms are optimized for their profit, not for your well being/productivity.


#### 4. Don’t chase perfection:
Perfectionism can be a productivity killer. While striving for excellence is admirable, chasing perfection can lead to excessive time spent on minute details and an inability to move forward.

Seek progress not perfection, perfection is just another name for procrastination.

As a perfectionist myself, I have for long struggled to meet deadlines. One approach that is particularly helpful is of ‘iterative development’. In this approach you don't attempt to make your final product/project in one go, instead you build it iteratively multiple times improving upon the previous version each time. This technique ensures that even if you fail to build your idealistically perfect product, you would have something to deliver.

This way the possibility of perfection is not compromised, while the fear of not being able to deliver is eliminated.

#### 5. Strong Commitment and Work Ethic:
Commitment instils a sense of purpose and meaning in your work. When you are committed, you are driven by a strong internal motivation to succeed.

> Are you committed or just involved?

While involvement signifies participation, commitment takes it a step further, indicating a deep dedication and perseverance towards achieving desired outcomes. By connecting your tasks to a larger purpose, you are more likely to invest the necessary effort and achieve higher levels of productivity. This dedication helps you stay focused, overcome obstacles, and maintain resilience in the face of challenges. Commitment provides the drive, purpose, and consistency necessary for achieving meaningful results.

Discipline helps you overcome distractions, procrastination, and the temptation to take shortcuts. It means consistently showing up, putting in the necessary effort, and staying focused on your goals.

Also, I would recommend to pursue the difficult tasks first, and smaller ones would usually take care of themselves.

> “If it’s your job to eat a frog, it’s best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it’s your job to eat two frogs, it’s best to eat the biggest one first”, said Mark Twain.

Lastly, I would like to mention that productivity is not about working tirelessly for hours on end. It’s about working with focus and taking strategic breaks. Our brains have limited attention spans, so it’s essential to work in short bursts of intense focus. Consider adopting the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for a concentrated period (typically 25 minutes) and then taking a short break (around 5 minutes). After completing a set of four cycles, take a more extended break of 15–30 minutes. This approach not only refreshes your mind but also provides opportunities for physical movement, which can boost your overall well-being.


### Conclusion
In a world of busyness, it’s important to recognize that true productivity goes beyond mere activity. By implementing proven strategies, we can boost our productivity and reclaim control of our time and energy. The key lies in focusing on one task at a time, setting SMART goals, learning to say ‘no,’ avoiding the trap of perfectionism, and embracing strong commitment and work ethic. Additionally, understanding the importance of strategic breaks and adopting techniques like the Pomodoro Technique can help us maintain focus and enhance overall well-being.
